<h1>Umbrella Bag Rockets</h1>

<p>This is a tutorial website to teach people how to build the umbrella bag rocket kit!</p>

<h2>Parts List</h2>

<p>You are encouraged to choose any materials you like. Feel free to use our design as guidance.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Umbrella Bag</strong> 3 x 36" 2 Mil Industrial Poly Bag <a href="https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-15166/">ULINE S-15166</a></li>
  <li><strong>Tape</strong> Any scotch tape will do. We use 12 of these stickers in each kit <a href="https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-11394/">ULINE S-11394</a></li>
  <li><strong>Fins</strong> Basic cardstock paper will work, like 65lb cardstock.  3 straight fins minimum for stability, and more can be exciting. Fins can be hoops too.</li>
  <li><strong>Ballast</strong> Basic cardstock paper will work. We use 65lb cardstock.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Build Instructions</h2>

<ol type = "1">
  <li><strong>Unpack</strong> Take everything out of the envelope</li>
  <li><strong>Inflate the Fuselage</strong> Get one piece of tape ready! Hold the open end of the bag to your mouth and fill the bag. When full, quickly twist the neck of the bag 10 times. Use the tape to seal the twisted end against the tube.</li>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Fins</strong> 
    <ol type = "1">
     <li><strong>Fold the Flange</strong> Take the large cardstock and bend one edge 1/2 inch (about 1cm) from the edge.</li>
     <li><strong>Cut the Fins</strong> Cut 3 (or 4) fins from the cardstock. You can be creative with the shape, but leave the flange.</li>
     <li><strong>Tape the Flange</strong> On each flange, add a piece of tape</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Attach the Fins</strong> Hold the Fins to the Fuselage in Even Spacing, and press the flange with the attached tape. Use a second piece of tape to secure the fin all the way.</li>
  <li><strong>Attach the Ballast</strong> Wrap the ballast around the fuselage and tape it to itself. Be careful to tape it only to itself so it can slide down the fuselage.</li>
  <li><strong>Balance the Rocket</strong> Balance the rocket on a finger to find the center of gravity. Then adjust the position of the balast so it is 1in (2.5cm) ahead of the center of gravity</li>
  <li><strong>Fly the Rocket</strong> Hold the rocket fuselage, and tap the back. The rocket will launch!</br>You can tune the rocket stability by moving the ballast.</li>
</ol>
